# tapeout-2023p2-umc180

This chip (40 PADs and Area = 1525 um X 1525 um = 2.32 mmÂ²) made with UMC 180nm and Cadence tools has:
- [Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with degeneration inductor](https://github.com/hugodiasg/lna-umc180);
- [CMOS Inverter 1.8 V](https://github.com/hugodiasg/inverter-umc180-cadence);
- 1 nH inductor to characterization;
- CMOS Inverter 3.3 V;
- Some transistors of different sizes for characterization.

Diodes were placed on the inverter gates to prevent antenna effects.
